Data GUIDs provide an easy-to-use and extensible namespace for describing data that gives programmers confidence their data can be later reused, or retracted. By decoupling data representation from data access, Data GUIDs allow a ground up representation of uniqueness that can span most cloud and on-premises service architectures. That means that software written around Data GUIDs will be easier to migrate from one platform to another, and that strong guarantees can be given that two parties are computing on the same data."

They can even build apps on top of my software to automate much of the process. And when my users are happy, I’m happy."
